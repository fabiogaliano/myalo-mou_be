# myaló mou

Inspired in the pronunciation of "my mind" in Greek, myaló mou serves the purpose of entering our own world of visual ideas.

The main goal of this project is to create my own visual library without folders. I want to effortlessly access whatever I saved, from image to videos, by simply asking what I need.

At his core, most of the ideas are borrowed from https://mymind.com. This exploratory project aims at replicate it from a perspective that can be hosted locally first.
